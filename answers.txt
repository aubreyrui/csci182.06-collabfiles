A. Why did you design the output of the network to be what you have in number 2? What was the idea as to why you chose this approach? (5 pts)


B. What special tokens did you insert in your vocabulary to be able to have a better translation model? (5 pts)


C. Explain the loss function that you chose and why it is appropriate for your chosen model design (5 pts)
Our group chose the Cross Entropy loss function for this model because we wanted to measure how well the model was performing. 
The cross-entropy is a popular loss function that is used to measure the performance of a classification machine learning model. 
It measures the difference between the probability distribution of a classification model and the predicted values of the model. 
This function is also known as logarithmic loss or log loss. More specifically, we wanted to quantify the ability of our model 
to correctly match the actual translation outcomes we wanted to acquire. Our group also opted to use Cross Entropy loss in comparison 
to something like MSE (Mean Squared Error) loss as we were making a classification model, and not developing a regression model.


D. If you were to input an english statement, how would you measure its correctness of translation? (5 pts)
